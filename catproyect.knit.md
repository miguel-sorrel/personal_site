Since September 2023, we have been launching this exciting project in which we will address topics such as the use of the graded response format in adaptive tests, the exploration of factorial structure, or the discussion on whether models for continuous or discrete traits should be employed to maximize reliability. We'll be sharing the results here, stay tuned!
