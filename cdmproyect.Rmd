Here we propose a one-parameter CDM that can provides accurate classifications and posterior probabilities under small sample scenarios. The model is already available at the *cdmTools* R package, please check the *RDINA()* function at the package version at Github (https://github.com/Pablo-Najera/cdmTools/). We'll submit shortly an updated version of the package to CRAN.

In this paper we examine the FoCo Shiny app to conduct CDM analysis. This is a user-friendly menu-based software in Spanish. The goal is to make CDM analysis more accesible to the broader audience and potential users.

Item parameter estimates under small sample settings might be unreliable. Thus, in this paper we proposed a multiple imputation procedure to account for the item parameter uncertainty in the computation of classification accuracy measures. 

This new procedure is available at the cdmTools R package. The only required input is a calibrated CDM using the GDINA R package:

cdmTools::CA.MI(GDINA.obj)

Range restriction is likely to happen when the sampling procedure is not random. In this paper we illustrate the implications that this might have in the context of factor analysis.
