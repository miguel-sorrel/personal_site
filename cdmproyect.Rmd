Existing diagnostic models mainly identify students' mastery of skills, with limited focus on uncovering specific scientific misconceptions. This article introduces a dual-purpose model (GDPM) to concurrently estimate overall ability and detect misconceptions. An expectation-maximization algorithm is devised for parameter estimation. A simulation study assesses parameter recovery accuracy under diverse conditions. Real data from science education validates the model's practical viability.

Cognitive diagnosis models, originating in educational measurement, offer detailed insights for formative assessment by classifying examinees on binary attributes. This chapter provides a concise overview of original models, extensions, and recent methodological developments. Topics covered include model estimation, Q-matrix specification, model fit evaluation, and procedures for validity and reliability. The chapter concludes with a discussion on future trends in the field.

Commonly used MMLE-EM estimation in CDMs faces issues with small sample sizes. This study compares various estimation methods for CDMs across sample sizes, using simulated and real data. Methods include MMLE-EM, Bayes modal, Markov chain Monte Carlo, non-parametric, and parsimonious parametric models like Restricted DINA. Findings show alternatives outperform MMLE-EM with small samples, yielding comparable results with larger samples. Practitioners should consider alternatives for accurate CDM parameter estimates with small samples. This study guides parameter estimation to maximize CDM potential.

Here we propose a one-parameter CDM that can provides accurate classifications and posterior probabilities under small sample scenarios. The model is already available at the *cdmTools* R package, please check the *RDINA()* function at the package version at Github (https://github.com/Pablo-Najera/cdmTools/). We'll submit shortly an updated version of the package to CRAN.

In this paper we examine the FoCo Shiny app to conduct CDM analysis. This is a user-friendly menu-based software in Spanish. The goal is to make CDM analysis more accesible to the broader audience and potential users.

Item parameter estimates under small sample settings might be unreliable. Thus, in this paper we proposed a multiple imputation procedure to account for the item parameter uncertainty in the computation of classification accuracy measures. 

This new procedure is available at the cdmTools R package. The only required input is a calibrated CDM using the GDINA R package:

Range restriction is likely to happen when the sampling procedure is not random. In this paper we illustrate the implications that this might have in the context of factor analysis.
