## Lab Philosophy

I want the lab to be a **healthy space** where science is enjoyable and everyone can grow.

I strive to:

- üå± Encourage curiosity and joy in doing science  
- ‚è∞ Allow flexible schedules and respect personal time  
- üó£Ô∏è Listen and treat everyone as equals  
- üéâ Acknowledge work, celebrate successes, and embrace failure  
- ü§ù Foster collaboration and professional development
