### [Computer programs and Apps] 

* FoCo: A Shiny App for Formative Assessment and Self-Evaluation of Competencies, creator, maintainer, project coordinator

Traditional educational assessment has been focused almost exclusively on rank-odering (e.g., Student A < Student B < Student C). Formative assessment aims to provide specific feedback to facilitate remedial instruction (e.g., Student A masters competency 1, but not 2 and 3; Student B masters competencies 1 and 2, but not 3…). To facilitate these applications we generated a Shinny app that allow for cognitive diagnosis modeling applications. You can access the app using the following link:
