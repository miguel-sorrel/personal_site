#### [Computer programs and Apps] 

* **FoCo: A Shiny App for Formative Assessment and Self-Evaluation of Competencies**, creator, maintainer, project coordinator

Traditional educational assessment has been focused almost exclusively on rank-odering (e.g., Student A < Student B < Student C). Formative assessment aims to provide specific feedback to facilitate remedial instruction (e.g., Student A masters competency 1, but not 2 and 3; Student B masters competencies 1 and 2, but not 3…). To facilitate these applications we generated a Shinny app that allow for cognitive diagnosis modeling applications. \\

Innovation Project PS_006.19_INN and PS_002.21_IMP funded by UAM. Other team members are: Rodrigo S. Kreitchmann, Francisco Jose Abad,  Carmen García, Jose Ángel Martínez-Huertas, David Moreno, Pablo Nájera, María Dolores Nieto, Ricardo Olmos, Cristina Rey Díaz, and Susana Sanz

* **cdcatS: A Shiny App for Formative Assessment and Self-Evaluation of Competencies**, co-author

This application allows for nonparametric CD-CAT implementations using the nonparametric item selection method. Users can create (upload item bank and Q-matrix) and administer item pools. \\

* **FCoptimization: A Genetic Algorithm for the Optimal Assembly of Pairwise Forced-Choice Questionnaires**, co-author.

This application aims to facilitate the construction of precise pairwise forced-choice questionnaires using the genetic algorithm presented by Kreitchmann, Abad and Sorrel (2021).
